when the x-ray fan out, how to we modify the back projection algorithm? 

it is called rebinning

**Constrain reconstraction**, typically not done in K-space.

This can fit in optimization routines like that in EE127

**neuclear medicine**

use $^{99m} T_{c}$

$$
^{99m} T_{c} \rightarrow ^{99} T_{c} + 140 Kev \gamma -ray
$$

this is a good tracer

because of the 140Kev x-ray

<100, will be absorbed by body

\>200. will penetrate thesepta of lead collimators.

> To increase SNR by 10, you have to increase does by 100
