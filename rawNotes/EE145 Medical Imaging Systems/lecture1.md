**resolution:** minimum separation W between two impulses in a source image that can be distinguished in final image

**The distinguishable angle of two impulse:**
Rayleigh criterion of Angular resolution
$$
\sin\theta_{R} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}
$$

**SNR** 
$$
SNR = \frac{S}{\sigma_n}
$$

S: signal(Volts)
$\sigma_n$: standard variation of noise 

**Constract to Noise ratio** CNR

ä¿º: constract is the difference between two tissue (interest part and background)

$$
CNR = \frac{SNR_A}{SNR_B} = \frac{S_A - S_B}{\sigma_n}
$$

# some vocabulary
Catheter: a thin tube puut into the body
lodine: chemical element that used in medical photography

vivo v.s. vitro: 
    in vivo:    within the living, experiment done on the living tissue
    in virto:   within the glass, experiments done in controlled environment

Tomography: a technique for displaying a representation of a cross section through a human body or other solid object using X-rays or ultrasound.

US: ultrosound

CT: computered Tomography

MRI: magnetic Resonance Imaging

# Some LTI system

linear, shift invariant
